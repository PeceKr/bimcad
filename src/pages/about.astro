                  After nine years of experience as a BIM Manager on major projects across 
                  Australia and UK, including stadiums, hospitals, and complex commercial 
                  developments, Ilija Loshonc developed a deep understanding of the power of 
                  BIM technology. He sees BIM not just as software or a 3D model, but as a way of 
                  thinking that enables smarter decisions, better coordination, and fewer errors 
                  throughout a building's lifecycle. Noticing a growing interest in BIM in Macedonia,
                  but also the clear lack of practical expertise and structured implementation, Ilija 
                  was inspired to create BIMCAD Studio.

                  The studio combines knowledge,technology, and collaboration, offering 
                  consulting, professional training, and outsourcing services to make BIM 
                  accessible, efficient, and effective for companies both locally and glob
