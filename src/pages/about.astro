                  <span class="text-white font-bold">After nine years</span> of experience as a <span class="text-white font-bold">BIM Manager</span> on major projects across
                  Australia and UK, including stadiums, hospitals, and complex commercial
                  developments, Ilija Loshonc developed a deep understanding of the power of
                  BIM technology. He sees BIM not just as software or a 3D model, but as a way of
                  thinking that enables smarter decisions, better coordination, and fewer errors
                  throughout a building's lifecycle. Noticing a growing interest in BIM in Macedonia,
                  but also the clear lack of practical expertise and structured implementation, Ilija
                  was inspired to create <span class="text-white font-bold">BIMCAD Studio</span>.

                  The studio combines knowledge,technology, and collaboration, offering
